# CyberHive-Tech-Test
1. The user should produce a Terraform script that:
a. Creates an AWS account
b. Builds a VPC within that account meeting the following criteria:

i. A CIDR block of 10.0.0.0/16
ii. Three subnets spread across different availability zones
iii. Has internet access (either internet gateway or NAT gateway)

c. Creates a small Ubuntu EC2 instance

i. The EBS volume of the instance should be encrypted with a customer-
managed KMS key.

ii. The instance security group should allow SSH, HTTP and HTTPs traffic
2. The user should then produce Ansible code that performs the following:
a. Configured the system hostname
b. Set the timezone to Europe/London
c. Configure IPTables rules to allow traffic on port 22; 80; 443; established and related
connections; ICMP from anywhere and have a standard input policy of DROP.
d. Installs Apache2 with apt
e. Ensure that Apache2 is started and itâ€™s service is enabled on startup
3. The completed code should be pushed to GitHub and shared with us.


# How to run script

The script should run by simply running terraform apply on the root module. Do note however that you might have to verify the authenticity of the remote host in order for the ansible config to run, so all you'd need to do is type in 'yes' when prompted on the terminal.



1. export $AWS_PROFILE 
2. run terraform init and terraform apply to provision the s3 bucket with  dynamodb_locking
3. uncomment out the aws_instance module to provision out the ec2 instance
4. 


# providers.tf
contains config for the default provider, as well as the provider for the newly created AWS account. This is so I can provision resources within the new account.


# Account
contains resources for setting up an AWS account via AWS organizations, currently not functioning as I've expereinced issues with creating/removing accounts.

# EC2
contains resources for building out the ec2 instances on each subnet, as well as the security group, vpc, subnet and ig

# ansible
contains yaml files needed to configure the newly created instance
